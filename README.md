# Day Planner

### User Story
The user needs to organise their day. This website allows them to do that. the work-day is divided into hour-long windows. These are color coded, with a background around the text input field. Red=present time, green=future, gray=past. The current date is displayed at the top of the page for reference. When the user types into a box, and clicks save the input is saved along with the time that it is with. This information stays in local storage until local storage is cleared.
